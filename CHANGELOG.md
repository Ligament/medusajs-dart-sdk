## [2.10.1] - 2024-12-09

### Fixed
- **Performance**: Updated to Medusa.js v2.10.1 for improved cart operations performance
- Reverted cart operation concurrency changes that caused performance regression
- Optimized cart-related HTTP requests response times

### Improved
- **Type Safety**: Replaced inappropriate `Map<String, dynamic>` usage with proper types
  - Added `AddressRequest` class for address creation/update operations
  - Added `ProductVariantOptionRequest` class for structured variant options
  - Updated `CreateDraftOrderRequest` and `UpdateDraftOrderRequest` to use `AddressRequest`
  - Updated `CreateProductVariantRequest` and `UpdateProductVariantRequest` to use proper option types
- **Cart Model**: Added helpful getters (`itemCount`, `isEmpty`, `hasItems`)
- Enhanced flexible type handling with better use of `Map<String, dynamic>` for metadata
- Improved API response compatibility for variable structures
- Better support for custom attributes and metadata fields

### Breaking Changes
- **Draft Order Requests**: `shippingAddress` and `billingAddress` now use `AddressRequest` instead of `Map<String, dynamic>`
- **Product Variant Requests**: `options` field now uses `List<ProductVariantOptionRequest>` instead of `Map<String, dynamic>`
- These changes improve type safety and IDE support while maintaining JSON serialization compatibility

### Notes
- This version fixes performance regressions introduced in v2.10.0
- Cart operations now perform at expected speeds matching previous versions
- No breaking changes from v2.10.0

## [2.10.0] - 2024-12-07

### Added
- **BREAKING**: Updated to Medusa.js v2.10.0 compatibility
- Added support for Shipping Option Types management
  - New `ShippingOptionType` model with label, description, and code
  - Admin resource `AdminShippingOptionTypeResource` for CRUD operations
  - Updated `ShippingOption` model to include optional `typeId` field
- Added `withDeleted()` method to `QueryBuilder` for querying deleted records (v2.10 feature)
- Enhanced fulfillment models with better type safety using `Map<String, dynamic>`

### Fixed
- Improved type consistency across models following Medusa v2.10 API changes
- Updated shipping option calculations to support new type-based filtering

### Notes
- This version introduces breaking changes from Medusa.js v2.10.0
- Shipping option types enable better categorization (e.g., Standard, Express)
- Query with deleted records now requires explicit `withDeleted()` flag
